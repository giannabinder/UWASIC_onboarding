## How it works
This is the UWASIC onboarding. 

This project implements an SPI-controlled PWM peripheral. The SPI module allows register writes to enable or disable static outputs or PWM modes on indiiual output pins. The PWM module generates a 3 kHz signal with adjustable duty cycle using an 8-bit control register.
